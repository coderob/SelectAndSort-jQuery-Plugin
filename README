-- DESCRIPTION --
Select items with an auto-complete search, then allow user to drag-and-drop sort the selected items

-- NOTES --
This plugin is still in beta stage. It is not (yet) fully encapsulated in a jQuery function. 
It is still tightly coupled to the markup (see source code JS for couplings).
